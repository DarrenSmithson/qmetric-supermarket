# Notes

Possibly create an enum set rather than 1 large enum for discounts
Add a name to item or product to ensure discounts arent applied to non discounted items that are in the same product category (Unit etc)
Possibly split the tests as basket test now streams over 20 tests
Tidy naming of tests
